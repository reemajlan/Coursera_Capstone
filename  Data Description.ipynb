He loves his coffee shop a lot and he takes very good care of it. Therefore, he used to go to it after work and spend the whole evening serving clients and making sure that they are happy and satisfied.\n\nRecently, he got a job offer in Scarborough. However, given the far distance from his current place, he unfortunately must move since he decided to accept the offer. He knew that the time he moves, it would be difficult for him to keep coming to the coffee shop and to keep the work going perfectly as usual.\n\nTherefore, he decided to relocate his coffee shop to be close to where he would live and work in Scarborough. This is a big decision to take because he might lose some of his clients. Therefore, before he moves forward with his decision, he needs to know if this is the right decision to take. He asked for a help to discover Scarborough and compare between the two neighborhoods. "
